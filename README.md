# ZNPCsPlus
[ZNPCsPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/znpcsplus.109380/) is an remake of the popular NPC plugin ZNPCs written with the Spigot/Bukkit API originally made by 
gonalez/ZNetwork. This project was originally started because the maintainer of ZNPCs decided to announce that he was 
[dropping support for the plugin](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093914615873806477/1098409384855474237/znpc.png).

### Dependencies
- Java 8
- Spigot 1.8 - 1.19.4
- PlaceholderAPI (OPTIONAL)

## Why is it better?
This fork makes several improvements over the original including:
- More performance-conscious code
- Latest version support (1.19.4)
- Fixes for long-running issues of the original plugin
- Better stability
- Support for multiple different storage options (WIP)
- Better command system (WIP)
