[ZNPCsPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/znpcsplus.109380/) is a Spigot plugin that is used to create fake entities 
that players can interact with to perform actions like switching servers on a network or executing commands.

This plugin is a remake of a plugin called ZNPCs, we originally started because the maintainer of ZNPCs decided to announce that he was 
[dropping support for the plugin](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1093914615873806477/1098409384855474237/znpc.png).

### Dependencies
- Java 8
- Spigot 1.8 - 1.19.4

## Why is it so good?
- 100% Packet Based - Nothing is ran on the main thread
- Performance & stability oriented code
- Support for all versions from 1.8 to 1.19.4
- Support for multiple different storage options (WIP)
- Intuitive command system (WIP)
